## Introduction

This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the day. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012 and include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.

The data for this assignment can be downloaded [Activity monitoring data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip) 

The variables included in this dataset are:

steps: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing values are coded as 𝙽𝙰) </br>
date: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD format </br>
interval: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which measurement was taken </br>
The dataset is stored in a comma-separated-value (CSV) file and there are a total of 17,568 observations in this dataset. 

## Loading and preprocessing the data
Unzip data to obtain a csv file.


```r
library("data.table")
library(ggplot2)
fileUrl <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip"
download.file(fileUrl, destfile = paste0(getwd(), '/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip'), method = "curl")
unzip("repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip",exdir = "data")
```

## Reading csv Data into Data.Table. 
a. Code for reading in the dataset and/or processing the data

```r
activityDT <- data.table::fread(input = "data/activity.csv")
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
a. Calculate the total number of steps taken per day


```r
Total_Steps <- activityDT[, c(lapply(.SD, sum, na.rm = FALSE)), .SDcols = c("steps"), by = .(date)] 
head(Total_Steps, 10)
```

```
##           date steps
##  1: 2012-10-01    NA
##  2: 2012-10-02   126
##  3: 2012-10-03 11352
##  4: 2012-10-04 12116
##  5: 2012-10-05 13294
##  6: 2012-10-06 15420
##  7: 2012-10-07 11015
##  8: 2012-10-08    NA
##  9: 2012-10-09 12811
## 10: 2012-10-10  9900
```

b. Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day


```r
ggplot(Total_Steps, aes(x = steps)) +
    geom_histogram(fill = "blue", binwidth = 1000) +
    labs(title = "Daily Steps", x = "Steps", y = "Frequency")
```

```
## Warning: Removed 8 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin).
```

c. Mean and median number of steps taken each day

```r
Total_Steps[, .(Mean_Steps = mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE), Median_Steps = median(steps, na.rm = TRUE))]
```

```
##    Mean_Steps Median_Steps
## 1:   10766.19        10765
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
a. Time series plot of the average number of steps taken


```r
IntervalDT <- activityDT[, c(lapply(.SD, mean, na.rm = TRUE)), .SDcols = c("steps"), by = .(interval)] 
ggplot(IntervalDT, aes(x = interval , y = steps)) + geom_line(color="blue", size=1) + labs(title = "Avg. Daily Steps", x = "Interval", y = "Avg. Steps per day")
```

![](PA1_template_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)<!-- -->

b. The 5-minute interval that, on average, contains the maximum number of steps


```r
IntervalDT[steps == max(steps), .(max_interval = interval)]
```

```
##    max_interval
## 1:          835
```


## Imputing missing values

a. Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with 𝙽𝙰s)


```r
activityDT[is.na(steps), .N ]
```

```
## [1] 2304
```

```r
# alternative solution
nrow(activityDT[is.na(steps),])
```

```
## [1] 2304
```

b. Code to describe and show a strategy for imputing missing data. A strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset using median/mean for that day


```r
# Filling in missing values with median of dataset. 
activityDT[is.na(steps), "steps"] <- activityDT[, c(lapply(.SD, median, na.rm = TRUE)), .SDcols = c("steps")]
```

c. Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.


```r
data.table::fwrite(x = activityDT, file = "data/tidyData.csv", quote = FALSE)
```

d. Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day after missing values are imputed


```r
# total number of steps taken per day
Total_Steps <- activityDT[, c(lapply(.SD, sum)), .SDcols = c("steps"), by = .(date)] 
# mean and median total number of steps taken per day
Total_Steps[, .(Mean_Steps = mean(steps), Median_Steps = median(steps))]
```

```
##    Mean_Steps Median_Steps
## 1:    9354.23        10395
```

```r
ggplot(Total_Steps, aes(x = steps)) + geom_histogram(fill = "blue", binwidth = 1000) + labs(title = "Daily Steps", x = "Steps", y = "Frequency")
```

Type of Estimate | Mean_Steps | Median_Steps
--- | --- | ---
First Part (with na) | 10765 | 10765
Second Part (fillin in na with median) | 9354.23 | 10395


## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
a. Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.


```r
# Just recreating activityDT from scratch then making the new factor variable. (No need to, just want to be clear on what the entire process is.) 
activityDT <- data.table::fread(input = "data/activity.csv")
activityDT[, date := as.POSIXct(date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")]
activityDT[, `Day of Week`:= weekdays(x = date)]
activityDT[grepl(pattern = "Monday|Tuesday|Wednesday|Thursday|Friday", x = `Day of Week`), "weekday or weekend"] <- "weekday"
activityDT[grepl(pattern = "Saturday|Sunday", x = `Day of Week`), "weekday or weekend"] <- "weekend"
activityDT[, `weekday or weekend` := as.factor(`weekday or weekend`)]
head(activityDT, 10)
```

```
##     steps       date interval Day of Week weekday or weekend
##  1:    NA 2012-10-01        0      Monday            weekday
##  2:    NA 2012-10-01        5      Monday            weekday
##  3:    NA 2012-10-01       10      Monday            weekday
##  4:    NA 2012-10-01       15      Monday            weekday
##  5:    NA 2012-10-01       20      Monday            weekday
##  6:    NA 2012-10-01       25      Monday            weekday
##  7:    NA 2012-10-01       30      Monday            weekday
##  8:    NA 2012-10-01       35      Monday            weekday
##  9:    NA 2012-10-01       40      Monday            weekday
## 10:    NA 2012-10-01       45      Monday            weekday
```

b. Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). See the [README file] (https://github.com/vickkiee/RepData_PeerAssessment1/blob/master/README.md) to see an what this plot should look like using simulated data.


```r
activityDT[is.na(steps), "steps"] <- activityDT[, c(lapply(.SD, median, na.rm = TRUE)), .SDcols = c("steps")]
IntervalDT <- activityDT[, c(lapply(.SD, mean, na.rm = TRUE)), .SDcols = c("steps"), by = .(interval, `weekday or weekend`)] 
ggplot(IntervalDT , aes(x = interval , y = steps, color=`weekday or weekend`)) + geom_line() + labs(title = "Avg. Daily Steps by Weektype", x = "Interval", y = "No. of Steps") + facet_wrap(~`weekday or weekend` , ncol = 1, nrow=2)
```
